# The Value of Local Features to Spot ‘Superspreaders’ on Twitter

This is the code produced to conduct the exploratory analysis for the research with abstract:

> The importance of influential nodes in any network is undeniable.
From pandemics prevention to information spreading,
some nodes play decisive roles. Many algorithms exist
to identify such nodes analyzing the graph from a global
perspective; however, these can be computationally expensive,
especially for large graphs. This article aims to identify
influential nodes by looking only at the local features of
a given node. Results show that it is unlikely that we can
find such nodes by only using local features, although it is
evident that they share some characteristics.
